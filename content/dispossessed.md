"[Brotherhood] begins in shared pain." — young Shevek

It is the nature of idea to be communicated: written, spoken, done. The idea is like grass. It craves light, likes crowds, thrives on crossbreeding, grows better for being stepped on.

To make a thief, make an owner. To create crime, create laws.

**"To be whole is to be part; true voyage is return."** — Odo

Since he was very young he'd known that in certain ways he was unlike anyone else he knew. For a child the consciousness of such difference is very painful, since, having done nothing yet and being incapable of doing anything, he cannot justify it. The reliable and affectionate presence of adults who are also, in their own way, different, is the only reassurance such a child can have ….

He was her brother, across a gulf of fifty years, and her redemption. (on Gvarab, Shevek's mentor at the Institute)

So many of [Shevek's] problems were of a kind other people did not understand that he had got used to working them out for himself.

There are souls … whose umbilicus has never been cut. They never got weaned from the universe. They do not understand death as an enemy; they look forward to rotting and turning into humus.

[Shevek's] gentleness was uncompromising; because he would not compete for dominance, he was indomitable.

"Do they expect students not to be anarchists? What else can the young be? When you are on the bottom, you must organize from the bottom up!" — Shevek

"The way to see how beautiful life is, is from the vantage point of death."

"… I'm not going to stand up at a gravestone and look down on life and say, "O, lovely!' I want to see it whole right in the middle of it, here, now." — Shevek and Takver

[Shevek] could not imagine a greater deterrent to the natural wish to learn than this pattern of cramming in information it and disgorging it on demand.

In a human sacrifice to a deity there might be at best a mistaken and terrible beauty; in the rites of the moneychangers, where greed, laziness, and envy were assumed to move all men's acts, even the terrible became banal.

**"You put another lock on the door and call it democracy."** —Shevek

"What is idealistic about social cooperation, mutual aid, when it is the only means of staying alive?" — Shevek

The individual cannot bargain with the State. The State recognizes no coinage but power: and it issues the coins itself.

"It would be utter folly for them to invade us, or us them. We've outgrown the kind of barbarism that used to bring war into the heart of the high civilizations! The balance of power is kept by this kind of police action." — Saio Pae on proxy warfare

The moment was gone; he saw it going. He did not try to hold on to it. He knew he was part of it, not it of him. He was in its keeping.

"You cannot buy the Revolution. You cannot make the Revolution. You can only be the Revolution. It is in your spirit, or it is nowhere." — Odo

"It isn't changing around from place to place that keeps you lively. It's getting time on your side. Working with it, not against it." — the driver

If you evade suffering you also evade the chance of joy. Pleasure you may get, or pleasures, but you will not be fulfilled. You will not know what it is to come home. … Loyalty … is the root of human strength; there is no good to be done without it. … The thing about working with time, instead of against it, … is that it is not waster. Even pain counts.

And least of all can you have the present, unless you accept with it the past and the future.

"Freedom is never very safe." — Shevek

"They say there is nothing new under any sun, but if each life is not new, each single life, then why are we born?" — Ketho

The sunlights differ, but there is only one darkness.

# Thoughts

There's a fundamental tension, it seems, between "propertarianism" (the propertariat??) and the innovation they can achieve VERSUS the Odonians' egalitarian but technologically inferior society. Shevek argues with Bedap that individual creativity and innovation are stunted by "the poverty of Anarres", that is, the necessity of labor to compensate for the lack of natural resources compared to Urras. As a result, everyone must sacrifice their desires and ideas for the greater good. "Human solidarity is our only resource." Bedap fires back that it is not solidarity, but *obedience* that reigns on Anarres. A government by majority is still a government — and Odonians are supposed to be anarchists. "[S]tability gives scope to the authoritarian impulse."
