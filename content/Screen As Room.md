title: "Screen As Room"
---
# Notes

- ðŸ‘€ [John Palmer essays](https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware/)
  - "space as model": spatial qualities (overlapping windows) code/dictate relationships, interactions
  - "subjective and metaphoric properties of rooms"; focusing on the manmade, constructed aspect of *rooms* rather than static, blank *spaces*
  - interfaces as children of architecture rather than film â€” the difference? **Agency**
      - choice to move through a space (screens), experience piecemeal at your own discretion

1. Sense of Agency

	  - Le Corbusier's Promenade: a composed architectural experience considered from various angles
	  - Emphasis on the experience of passing through a space
	  - "options for possibilities of action" have all been considered, framed, and constructed

2. Sense of Proportion

	  - devs can make a site feel large or small, as architects can make a space feel cozy or spacious

3. Sense of Protection

	  - boundary or enclosure?
	  - (im)permeability of that barrier between this "room" and the outside. smaller and easier to work with, but risk not being able to scale (not sure what he means)
	  - "Rhetorical boundaries": implied boundaries
		  - how do these manifest in digital spaces?

4. Base for Customization

	  - adaptability and longevity of buildings... in digital space? adaptive reuse?
	  - "how adaptable ... are our interfaces?"
		  - the Windows phone example, balancing clarity (grid) with customization (your order)
	  - ðŸ‘€ [End User Programming](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming.html#why-end-user-programming)

5. A Shared Space

	  - **Proxemics:** nonverbal communication through the use of space
	  - **Social Presence Theory:** transmission of social cues through various media; indicators of presence _e.g. "Online" status, cursor position, etc_
	  - space as an entire medium for communication (think closing the door when you want privacy)
	  - room as Agent! A sense of Place is created through habit, use, and play; the room becomes a player

6. Shaper of Behavior

	  - we swiftly understand the _constraints_ on our actions in a new software or environment; a good dev ensures they feel like logical trains of thought/behavior, not constraints
	  - **Place:** a space permeated by social norms. Highly ritualized.
	  - **Nudge theory:** spatial order of objects can influence interactions (salad bar at the front of the line)

7. Purposefully Articulated Space

	  - "dev-built" house/software meets needs piecemeal rather than holistically. thus the whole is not harmoniously composed
	  - great design can only occur when many questions/problems are neglected in favor of a handful?

> Forced simplicity results in oversimplification. [â€¦] Where simplicity cannot work, simpleness results. Blatant simplification means bland architecture. Less is a bore.

# Thoughts

The most compelling bit for me is his fifth point: shared space. Think of the ways in which we communicate through our use of space. Labacher used the example of working with your door open or closed to indicate your openness to social interaction. Furthermore, our space overlaps with others: a shared kitchen or bathroom, even passing others in the hallway requires some navigation of what Labacher calls the _interaction space_, the overlap of multiple persons' _peripersonal spaces_. User interfaces try to emulate presence and intention through indicators like "online," "typing...," and the dreaded "Seen âœ”". But how can they emulate that overlap in space? Collaborative writing platforms come to mind, where your blinking cursor may zip past someone else's, or another person may blink, unmoving, within a block of text selected by another user. Or shared project management platforms, which I'm sure have some such feature (I've never used PM software in a team setting).  
  
His observation about purposefully articulated space was also interesting. Mass-produced ("developer-built") software, like houses, are often produced for the market, resulting in a conventionally functional product without regard to the union of utility, form, and purpose. I distinguish between utility and purpose with utility being the function (I use VSCodium to code) and purpose being the intention (VSCode is made for coding). So many cookie-cutter suburban houses have utility, but the form and purpose are lacking â€” how many can be called homes, truly made to be lived in? How many meals are meant to be tasted, not just consumed? How many interfaces are meant to be explored, not just browsed?  
  
I think a lot about video games as spatial experiences. I don't have a VR rig (I've only tried it once) but the feeling of being placed in an entirely different space has lingered like a particularly dirty lick at a blues jam. I look at the games I play, how they use perspective, angle, and scale. I never really brought that mode of thinking to interfaces. Reading this essay was really eye-opening and will certainly lead to further study.
