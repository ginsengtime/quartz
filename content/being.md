title: "being"

> Our mind is constantly thinking, our eyes perceiving screens or books, our ears listening, and our mouths speaking. Yet, what about those other parts of our bodies: stomach, chest, shoulders, legs, knees, backs, and so on? Amid deadlines and reviews,these non-productive parts of our bodies are rendered invisible.

Shahjahan calls on us to be "lazy" and "slow down."

  - Lazy  
    being at peace with not doing or not being productive. Divesting ourselves from the need for some result over some time.
  - Slowing Down  
    building relationships and connections \> production. Acceptance of and allowance for ambiguity, uncertainty of outcomes.

We need to [[re-embody]] ourselves: re-center our awareness on our bodies, our physical wellbeing, and our presence in space.

> With the introduction of the clock, time was delinked from human bodies, and human bodies from nature.

When was the last time I went a day without looking at a clock? Sleep, meals, exercise â€” essential activities to our livelihood and health have been de-prioritized in favor of time. We make time to eat between meetings, stay up far too late to finish a project. Western notions of linear, immutable [[time]] have severed the link between humans and the natural cycles of which we are but one small part, no matter how late we stay up staring at our screens.
