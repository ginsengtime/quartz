> The proper use of time has become a measure of moral character.

"Wasting time" has become a mark of immorality, of not-enough-ness. You're lazy, so you don't deserve... Shahjahan writes within academia, where professors and students alike are plagued by the pressure to "be productive" and use their time in ways deemed acceptable, so as to maintain their standing in their communities. However, this pressure often marginalizes/excludes persons with different needs and abilities, as well as those who experience time and progress differently from the linear model Eurocentric time requires.

> ... time is an epistemic tool through which a chronology of difference was created by colonial logic. Time became a trajectory against which to measure indigenous and other subaltern individuals and groups in terms of the degree to which they are out of sync, behind in development, anachronistic, and resistant to progress.

The hegemony of linear time has been used time and again as a justification for colonialism: indigenous people are "lesser" because they aren't "as far along," and so they must be uplifted and brought up to speed. This colonial logic of time has invaded our personal lives — we aren't keeping up with other people our age, we aren't being progressive or innovative in our usage of time, etc.

# shifts in understandings of [[time]]
[[Walker]]

pre-modern age: long-term evolutionary relationship between humanity and nature. Cyclical, "glacial" understanding of time. A "timeless time" of generational, not annual, cultural shifts.

> Under capitalism, time became commodified and considered a resource; like money, we say that time can be wasted, saved, or spent.

  - clock-time (modern time)  
    closely linked with Protestant/Puritan morality and the ruthless quest for efficiency that characterizes capitalism... But once it hit 5, you're off the clock\!
  - global time (postmodern time)  
    characterized by time-space compression; you are no longer entirely on your own time, as tasks may depend on the activities of someone halfway round the world — tasks whose results impact you instantly, from financial transactions to file uploads. efficiency and morality aspects of modern time not only remain, but are intensified, as new technologies make it so much easier to save time.
