Well-designed interfaces should be akin to buildings: intentionally created structures with various rooms inside that have clear purpose, meaning, and intent. Consider user agency and the vibe of each room. Is it cozy? Spacious? How is it meant to be used or interacted with? Extending the room from an individual to a group experience, how can interfaces help us communicate as we do in physical spaces (eg leaving the door open when working)? Overall, how do we address user experience holistically to create a unifying purpose to the interface? (from [[Screen As Room]])
