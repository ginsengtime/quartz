title: "Rashidun"
---
Lit. "rightly guided." Considered a model ([[vocab/Sunna]]) from a religious PoV; contrast with the perceived corruption of the [[Umayyad caliphate]]. Comprised four caliphs (kalifa, alt. Amir al-Mu'minin, lit. "leader of the faithful"):

1.  [[vocab/Abu Bakr]] (632–634)
2.  [[vocab/'Umar bin al-Khattab]] (634–644)
3.  [[vocab/'Uthman bin 'Affan]] (644–656)
4.  [[vocab/'Ali bin Abi Talib]] (656–661)

Despite many historical accounts painting an idyllic picture, this period was full of tensions and ill will like any other. Hell, three of the Rashidun (everyone after Abu Bakr) were assassinated by other Muslims\! Any society transitioning between modes of leadership and looking for a framework that fits is gonna have a rough time. But what specifically was going on?

  - The continuation of Muhammad's expansion/unification project was a little fraught. Among tribes that gave him [[vocab/Bayca]], many recognized the leadership of Muhammad the individual, not the wider Muslim community-in-the-making that he represented. As a result, many historical sources posit Islam as a sort of divine process that brought these loose cannons back in line. This includes the narrative of the Ridda Wars, or wars against apostasy: violence was justified against apostates! Sounds familiar *glances at literally every organized religion*
  - Nominations for caliph weren't universally accepted. Fiscal or administrative policies could and did alienate portions of the populace, and that feeling of marginalization is never good. Also, especially in the case of Ali, the line of succession/method of selection bred resentment (that, eventually, led to the emergence of the Shiite sect).

So internal conflicts and also expansionism kicked off Muslim control of the Arabian peninsula and its tribal population. The establishment of various state apparatuses (apparati?), administration/bureaucracy, and unified policy also contributed to a centralized, hierarchical State (ooh that capital S is jumpin out).
