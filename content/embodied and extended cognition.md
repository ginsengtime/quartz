# Embodied and Extended Cognition

  - Embodied cognition  
    cognitive processes taking place in the body but outside the brain. Example: octopus arms have their own neurons

the body codes the workings of the mind ([[deprivileging the mind/intellect]])

> \[The mind is\] not a kind of software being run on the logical-processesing unit of the brain.

The body and mind are inseparable. We distinguish between them, but the reality is they are one and the same.

  - Extended cognition  
    cognitive processes taking place through external apparati. Example: [[spiderwebs]] taking in/storing information through vibrations. (technology??)

<!-- end list -->

  - the spiderwebs piece reminds me of the Adrian Tchaikovsky novel, *Children of Time*, which includes an advanced race of spiders who communicate, think, and do basically everything with their webs. Guess that's where he got it from\!
  - is language an instance of extended cognition, or is it only a tool we use to extend our cognition?
  - the connection to Marx's theory that "we only become conscious in and through the world and its history" is tenuous imo. Like how are products of labor (that do, I agree, reflect our conscious) related to extended cognition?
      - these objects are expression, not cognition. although perhaps i'm limiting myself in my conception of objects

> And the world of inert objects might think too, in slow and strange ways which we can only borrow for a moment, and which disappear again into what sounds like silence.

Hmmm... Equal parts physics and randomness? It seems the author casts a wide net when it comes to cognition — more like autonomous/self-ordered systems than things that can "think."
