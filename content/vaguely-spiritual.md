Organized religion isn't my thing. But I think religion and what it has, does, and will represent for people — and how it, in turn, carves so many of the tributaries and overall shape of societies — is very neat. So in studying history more intentionally, I'm studying religion, too. Win/win\! More knowledge\! More understanding of people through time\!

I do not intend to offend anybody with my notes or my interpretation of religious texts or figures. I cannot change where I come from or how I have come to understand religion, only where I go from here. If something in my notes is way off-base, please let me know.
