title: "Intimacy Gradient and Other Lessons from Architecture"
---
## from architect Christopher Alexander in his book [A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction. (Oxford University Press, 1977)](http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/)_

**Intimacy Gradient**: laying out spaces such that the course from the entrance inwards corresponds to a sense of public to private.

Distinguishing between public & private

-   ceiling height
    -   japanese tea house. also a lot of places w high-ceiling vestibules
-   stairs to another floor
    -   daunt books in london — the bottom floor feels so much more intimate!!
-   narrow entrance
    -   doorways inside an art gallery vs the front entrance


## from _Building Smart Communities through Network Weaving_

[Krebs and Holley, “Building Smart Communities through Network Weaving.”](http://127.0.0.1:8080//#Krebs%20and%20Holley%202006)

four stages of a vibrant community network:

1.  scattered clusters
2.  single hub-and-spoke
3.  multi-hub small-world network
4.  core/periphery
    -   core should be densely linked but still have access to a dynamic periphery to allow for the influx of new ideas


## recreating the intimacy gradient using architectural patterns
(from Alexander)

Allen wrote this in 2004, long before anything like the social media we had today was even imaginable, I think. He's not written a long-form article since 2016, [The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity,"](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html) which seems an interesting read — I definitely want to check it out soon. Anyways, I wonder how we have, have not, and still can bring this concept of the intimcy gradient into contemporary digital spaces. I feel like many sites here on Neocities, and elsewhere, unconsciously do this with an "Enter" page; I've also seen sites that have different layouts or color schemes for certain sections (shrines, journal, etc) that accomplish a similar purpose. (Now that I think of it, my own site doesn't do this... time for a change?)

How do modern social media sites fit into this framework? The FB and Insta homepages come to mind: regular users will seldom see them, but that's a sort of public-facing screen. As you curate your feed, social media goes beyond intimate and into _personal_; perhaps that's the main break from the old Web. Rather than entering other people's space (websites), we have our private bubbles provided by a large-scale service. It's not "intimate" so much as it is ours (as much as you can own your own feed...). What do we lose in this shift? I think we lose that sense of connection, as we no longer have to navigate spaces outside our own if we so choose. It's just us and the echo chamber.

Allen pulls a few architectural patterns from _A Pattern Language_ as possible implementations of the intimacy gradient:

-   **Promenade:** a public center for each subculture, a place to see and be seen by others in your sphere
-   **Small Public Squares:** "largest, most public rooms, that a tow
    -   chat rooms?
-   **Public Outdoor Room:** a place to be able to hang out "outside"
    -   i'm not sure how to distinguish between this and the promenade except you're not exactly expected to mingle here
-   **Sequence of Sitting Spaces:** different sitting spaces with different setups (comfort, intended length of sit) based on intimacy of room
-   **Communal eating**

## other theories

-   **refuge and prospect:** refuge = retreat, prospect = seeing others. In conflict at all times, as we as humans prefer our refuge but must also meet our social needs (sounds like an intro/ambivert thing but i jive w it) —hence why we enjoy rooms with spacious views?
    -   what are the limits of our social spaces? where do we turn for refuge and prospect in a digital context?
-   **defensible theory:** anonymous, "undefined" spaces are targets for crime and vandalism. How do we take possession of our virtual spaces, as communities?
