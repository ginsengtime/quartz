title: "The hadith on opening Muhammad's breast & belly (314)"

  >  Ibn Humayd — Harun b. al-Mughirah and Hakkam b. Salm — 'Anbasah — Abu Hashim al-Wasiti — Maymun b. Siyah — Anas b. Malik: At the time when the Prophet became a prophet, he used to sleep around the Kacba as did the Quraysh. On one occasion two angels, Gabriel and Michael, came to him and said, “Which of the Quraysh were we ordered to come to?" Then they said, "We were ordered to come to their chief," and went away. After this they came from the Qiblah and there were three of them. They came upon him as he slept, turned him on his back, and opened his breast. Then they brought water from Zamzam and washed away the doubt, or polytheism, or pre-Islamic beliefs, or error, which was in his breast. Then they brought a golden basin full of faith and wisdom, and his breast and belly were filled with faith and wisdom. Then he was taken to the earthly heaven…

The above is the version provided by [[the course]] — I'm interested to read other versions of this [[Arab-Islamic History/vocab/Hadith]].

  - Qiblah

  - Zamzam  
    A holy well dating back to the time of Abraham.

Most striking thing: the passivity of Muhammad. He's asleep\! I think this shows that he was chosen to be a prophet — he had no say in it. In this way, he cannot be called a false or self-proclaimed messenger.

I wonder why the angels asked a question and immediately answered it. Maybe it was one speaking to the other. Either way, I think they doubted that Muhammad was the chief. When they come again from Qiblah, it really hammers home that 👏🏽 they 👏🏽 are 👏🏽 holy. The portrayal of polytheistic, pre-Islamic beliefs as doubt and error isn't surprising. I think the sequence is a general sketch of what to do as a good Muslim? Or to accept God's message? Like you have to cast out other beliefs from your heart and fill yourself (or be filled) with faith and wisdom.
