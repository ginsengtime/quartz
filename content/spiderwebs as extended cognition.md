# Case study: spiderwebs as extended cognition apparati

HOT TAKE: spiderwebs are an instance of [[embodied and extended cognition|extended cognition]]. ie webs are cognitive apparati that serve as sensory organs, of a sort, for the spider.

  - Animal cognition strategies
      - embodied (octopus)
      - specialized senses (UV vision)
      - structures outside neural system (spiders?)
      - ❓ are there examples of non-neuronal info processing in other species? I feel like it can't be that rare...
      - is, say, the cane used by a vision-impaired person an example?

❓ What is the difference between a tool and an extended cognition apparatus?

According to Japyassú, cognition = acquiring, manipulating, and storing info. Critics say cognition must also include *interpretation* of that information into an "abstract, meaningful representation of the world."

  - Niche construction  
    animals making specialized structures like nests, dams etc.

  - interplay with structure and environment ultimately causes changes in the organism, thereby changing the structure.... (extended phenotype)

> “It is conceivable for cognition to be a property of a system with integrated nonbiological components,” Cross and Jackson write. “That seems to be where Homo sapiens is headed.”
