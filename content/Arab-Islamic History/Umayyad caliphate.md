title: "Umayyad caliphate"
---
The era following the [[Arab-Islamic History/Rashidun|Rashidun]]. Lasted 661–750.

Emerged from the [[First]] [[Fitna]] which had started with 'Uthman's assassination in 656. It lasted until 661, when [[Mu'awiya bin Abi Sufyan]] became caliph. With this, the hands that held power shifted from those of the [[Arab-Islamic History/vocab/Sahaba|Sahaba]] to those of the elite. Which honestly is a weird slap in the face to literally everyone, since Mu'awiya is one of the Quraysh, who [[Arab-Islamic History/vocab/Hijra|drove Muhammad out of Mecca]] in the first place? But go off, I guess.

The rest of Mu'awiya's reign was relatively peaceful. His death in 680, however, sparked the [[Second Fitna]]. Yet again, the marginalized tribes on the fringes were raring to fight. And once again, Muslims within the budding empire (? society? what's a good word) were feeling alienated. This time, it was non-Arab Muslims who felt disenfranchised in relation to Arab-Muslims and their elite ruling class. Also, the Umayyads had set up shop in Damascus, establishing a central seat of political power in the Levant while Mecca and Medina (and their elites) clung to religious clout. Yikes on bikes, babes. And in fact, the Umayyads besieged Mecca TWICE, which was a very bad look. I mean, bringing arms to the holiest place in your religion? You can see why historians didn't look very favorably on the Umayyads.

That's not to say they were all bad. As architects of the early Muslim state, they took a lot of steps to consolidate power and solidify Muslim religious and political (self-?)identity. They minted coins\! Established bureaucratic centers\! Made Arabic the main language of regional trade\! Commissioned grand buildings and directed estates\! ...Not that that helped their image much. Both contemporary sources and those of the subsequent [[Arab-Islamic History/ISLAM101x L3|Abbasid caliphate]] (which probably had a vested interest in talking themselves up versus the old regime) were highly critical of the Umayyads. They were secular, they were despotic, their rule didn't last long and *you know whyyy? \*shakes fist\** I guess you can pour all the money you want into statecraft, but if you're gonna do a lot of stuff counter to the religion that forms the bedrock of the state, people aren't gonna like you. Go figure.

# Space & Power
The al-Aqsa Mosque was an important administrative center for the Umayyads, as Prof. Miri and Prof. Gideon Avni explain. Something I didn't realize was that Jerusalem was still Christian when the Muslims showed up in ~638! Church of the Holy Sepulcher and everything! I didn't pay attention in Sunday school, as you can tell. All the construction around the building, including the famous Dome on the Rock, didn’t seek to eradicate Christianity but confirmed Muslim establishment right in the city.

- The Umayyads also constructed several grand, isolated desert palaces, many of which were on the outskirts of but still linked to major urban centers. With the palaces came roads and infrastructure esp thanks to ‘Abd al-Malik (fifth caliph).
	- Hisham’s Palace (Jericho)
		- Persian (Sassanian), Egyptian, inner Asian architectural styles > Greek, Byzantine, Roman
		- A country club? Divisions between leisure and business areas
		- How the hell did they eat and drink?? Where do the provisions come from? Desert palaces were actually within vast agricultural networks, fields, reservoirs, terraced farms – made possible in part by qanats
			- *Qanat*: underground aqueducts that conveyed water dozens of Kms to palace surroundings
- What happened to desert palaces when the Abbasids took over tho
	- traditional view states general (ehhh) destruction/calamity tore em up, e.g. 749 earthquake
	- however there is evidence, e.g. in Hisham’s Palace, of both the quake and of reconstruction
	- Other evidence suggests a shift from business+pleasure places to simply estates, with agriculture, wine production
(I mean it makes sense to me. bigass palace in the desert – what are you gonna do, tear it down? like you don’t have more stone somewhere? just repurpose it)


### to read up on later

  - Islamic Golden Age – this is what I am really curious about. I've been wanting to learn about the Golden Age for... ages. Astronomy, math, history/historiography, political and social sciences – so many huge leaps and bounds in this era and beyond\! I wonder how this political context influenced the scientific and artistic achievements of the Golden Age.
  - Mu'awiya had a long history before his ascension. I want to learn about it.
