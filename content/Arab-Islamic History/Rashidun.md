title: "Rashidun"
---
Lit. "rightly guided." Considered a model ([[Arab-Islamic History/vocab/Sunna|sunna]]) from a religious PoV; contrast with the perceived corruption of the [[Arab-Islamic History/Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad caliphate]]. Comprised four caliphs (kalifa, alt. Amir al-Mu'minin, lit. "leader of the faithful"):

1.  [[Arab-Islamic History/people/Abu Bakr|Abu Bakr]] (632–634)
2.  [[Arab-Islamic History/people/Umar|'Umar bin al-Khattab]] (634–644)
3.  [[Arab-Islamic History/people/Uthman|'Uthman bin 'Affan]] (644–656)
4.  [[Arab-Islamic History/people/Ali|'Ali bin Abi Talib]] (656–661)

Despite many historical accounts painting an idyllic picture, this period was full of tensions and ill will like any other. Hell, three of the Rashidun (everyone after Abu Bakr) were assassinated by other Muslims\! Any society transitioning between modes of leadership and looking for a framework that fits is gonna have a rough time. But what specifically was going on?

  - The continuation of Muhammad's expansion/unification project was a little fraught. Among tribes that gave him [[Arab-Islamic History/vocab/Bayca|bayca]], many recognized the leadership of Muhammad the individual, not the wider Muslim community-in-the-making that he represented. As a result, many historical sources posit Islam as a sort of divine process that brought these loose cannons back in line. This includes the narrative of the Ridda Wars, or wars against apostasy: violence was justified against apostates! Sounds familiar *glances at literally every organized religion*
  - Nominations for caliph weren't universally accepted. Fiscal or administrative policies could and did alienate portions of the populace, and that feeling of marginalization is never good. Also, especially in the case of Ali, the line of succession/method of selection bred resentment (that, eventually, led to the emergence of the Shiite sect).

So internal conflicts and also expansionism kicked off Muslim control of the Arabian peninsula and its tribal population. The establishment of various state apparatuses (apparati?), administration/bureaucracy, and unified policy also contributed to a centralized, hierarchical State (ooh that capital S is jumpin out).

-   Abu Bakr appointed Umar    
-   Uthman was picked bc his plans would be good for Quraysh (over Ali)
	-   and that favoritism got him killed lmao
    -  I also feel like Uthman’s obsession with the Qurayshi –  specifically the Umayyad clan – being fit to rule directly foreshadowed the establishment of the Umayyad dynasty
-   So when Ali came to power the Qurayshi were sus (even those who thought Uthman was doing a bit too much)

### 'Umar and administration
'Umar, a legend, got the ball rolling on a lot of key adminstrative reforms, especially related to fiscal and tax policy. He initially built on Sassanid/Byzantine frameworks, e.g. employing former officials with those bureaus according to their ajnad (a type of political unit). Those sorta ad hoc systems solidified and morphed over time to fit Islamic law and rulership. Under 'Umar's rulership, a monetary system incorporating Sassanian and Byzantine coinage was established which facilitated trade and tax collection. He ALSO fixed salaries and benefits for military folks. What a guy!   By the late Rashidun period, these administrative systems had been reorganized multiple times to be as efficient as possible as well as in close alignment with Islamic law.
