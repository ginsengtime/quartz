## Overview

Following [[Arab-Islamic History/ISLAM101x L1-5|Muhammad]]'s death in 632, there followed a crucial transition period between his era and that of great empires. Two main periods: [[Arab-Islamic History/Rashidun|Rashidun]] (lit. "Rightly Guided") caliphate (632–661) then the [[Arab-Islamic History/Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad caliphate]] (661–750).

  - Similarities
      - political experimentation
          - Rashidun were elected by a council OR chosen based on predecessor's wishes
          - Umayyads were dynastic (power passed through lineage) and were the first major Muslim dynasty (to be followed by the Abbasids etc.
      - Violent! Lots of internal struggle and strife – civil war-like. Growing pains?
      - State formation: from the relatively intimate Muslim community around the Hejaz, the Muslim sphere of influence spread throughout the Middle East AND became more socially/politically stratified.
  - Difference: historical perception
      - Rashidun seen as the ideal by Sunni Muslims
      - Umayyads were inadequate, maybe corrupt, secular monarchy
