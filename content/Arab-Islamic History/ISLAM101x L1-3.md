  - Major players: Byzantine Empire, Sassanid Empire, and Kingdom of Axum.
      - **Byzantine**: formerly Roman Empire. Greek + Orthodox Christian
      - **Sassanid**: Persian + Zoroastrian
      - **Axum**: Orthodox Christians; associated with Coptic Church of Alexandria
  - Two pronged involvement via patronage and brokerage
      - **Patronage**: rise of the Ghassanids (Byzantine) and Lakhmid (Sassanid) kingdoms as vassal states
          - Originally tribes from south emigrated north and established kingdoms in collaboration with local Christian communities
      - later, buffer states between the two kingdoms
      - **Brokerage**: lack of central government among nomadic peoples → Byz/Sass/vassal involvement in internal affairs (sometimes)
          - they even (*sometimes*) collected taxes\!?
  - Position of the peninsula along Asia-Middle East oceanic trade route gave Arabia strategic importance to these kingdoms
  - \~600 Arab kingdoms collapsed → direct Byzantine-Sassanid conflict → WEAK\!\! Al-Tabari suggests this helped along the 7th-century Arab Muslim conquest (I believe it)
  - <span class="underline">**570**</span>: The Year of the Elephant (and birth year of Muhammad)
      - Axumites launch an invasion, making for Mecca astride elephants. They failed tho
          - Qur'an: God sent small birds that dropped stones and forced the Axumites to retreat. A holy omen foretelling Muhammad's birth
      - Historical evidence tells us the invasion probably took place BEFORE 570 but definitely happened in any case.
  - Consequences: rulership strategies and knowledge of monotheistic practices
