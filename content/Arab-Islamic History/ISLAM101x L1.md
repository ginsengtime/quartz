title: "ISLAM101x L1: Early Islamic Arabia"
---
Before we talk about the life of the prophet Muhammad, we must look at the state of the Arabian peninsula in the sixth century. In general, the north was more nomadic tribes while the south was more centralized/sedentary polities. Oral culture was big. Though nomadic groups were largely polytheistic/animist, monotheism was by no means unheard of, thanks to neighboring Jewish and Christian societies. Even so, this pre-Islamic period is referred to in Islamic texts as Jahiliyya, which has both a chronological and negative moral connotation (because of paganism). The term speaks to Islamic self-perception "of superiority of Islam and Muslims." (professor quote)

Now onto the wider stage â€” [[Arab-Islamic History/ISLAM101x L1-5|who and what were on the borders of the Arabian peninsula]]? We had three major players: the Byzantine Empire, the Sassanid Empire, and the Kingdom of Axum. They patronized and brokered between many of these groups, allowing them to insert themselves into Arabian politics rather than simply staying on the fringes. From them, Arabs gained valuable strategies for rulership and insight into monotheistic practices, both of which would come to the fore in the early Islamic state.

## Muhammad: The Individual

  - 570 AD
    Muhammad is born in Mecca. The [[Arab-Islamic History/vocab/Kacba|Kacba]] was already in Mecca at the time, although it was a center for polytheistic religion.
  - 595 AD
    Muhammad marries Khadija.

Muhammad establishes himself and a new power base, the [[Arab-Islamic History/vocab/Ansar|Ansar]].
  - 630 AD

  - 632 AD

Muhammad served a [[Arab-Islamic History/ISLAM101x L1-5|variety of roles]] throughout his life, from businessman to politician as well as prophet. His family, the Banu-Hashim clan, had a lot of clout in regional trade and religion. He was, however, orphaned at a young age and raised by paternal relatives. We know much about him and his life through the retellings of his companions (the [[Arab-Islamic History/vocab/Sahaba|Sahaba]]) and others. The customs, deeds, and sayings of Muhammad are collected in the [[Arab-Islamic History/vocab/Hadith|Hadith]] and portray the [[Arab-Islamic History/vocab/Sunna|sunna]], the model of Muhammad.
