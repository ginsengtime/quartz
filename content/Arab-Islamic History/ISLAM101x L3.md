---

# rise to power
- Third Fitna (740s): Umayyad rule was challenged by those who said only close relatives of M should rule (along with Arab soldiers in Iran and non-Arab Muslims in Iraq/Iran) 
- Abbasids had already been secretly clout chasing – only went public with their claims to powers in the last years of the Umayyad caliphate, so it was really easy for Al-Saffah to get a spicy bay’a in southern Iran and become the first Abbasid caliph.    
- Abbasids used regnant titles, always including “Allah”   
	-   titles imply that Abbasid authority is derived from God, not relation to M
	-   historian’s note: convention dictates abbreviated title, appellation, minus common element
- **762**: al-Mansur establishes the capital in Baghdad
	- Location, location, location! Iraq (and specifically Baghdad) was north of former Sassanian capital Ctesiphon
	- They even used some stones from Ctesiphon to symbolize their victory. 💅🏾
	- Walled, round city (palace+mosque at center)
	    - reflected Islamic ideas of paradise
	    - heavy Persian influence rather than Arabic

## women and the harem
- [[Arab-Islamic History/vocab/Harem|Harem]]s weren't the orientalist fantasy that we all know and loathe! Women (from family members to singers) and children lived in this enclosed area of the homes of the wealthy, especially the imperial/dynastic family.
- The imperial Harem was an enclosed space, with strict etiquette and hierarchy; the involvement of women was accordingly formal and routine.
	- Women couldn't be heads of state, but they networked in/directly with important figures, some rising to be famous advisors!
- Khayzuran
	- Beloved of Al-Mahdi, mother of Al-Hadi and Al-Rashid -- both of whose ascension to the throne was thanks to her influence and guidance
	- Her legal status as a concubine had no negative influence on her or her sons bc sTaTuS rEsTeD wItH mEn (vom)
- Zubayda (married Al-Rashid)
	- Legendary philanthropy surrounding water supplies and pilgrimage road to Mecca
	- Public image (as a noblewoman) facilitated her public support of her son's ascession

## bureaucracyyyy
The Abbasids were big on bureaucracy, especially as the Islamic state matured into a proper empire. Development of bureaucratic circles was driven by a couple big things: shifting backgrounds among katibs (scribes), and growing expertise in clerkship.

Recall that 'Umar [[Arab-Islamic History/Rashidun#'Umar and administration|initiated]] several important administrative reforms. At this time, the frameworks for those admin systems were still very Sassanian and Byzantine — evidenced by a lack of Arab/Muslim professional admins plus continued usage of Persian and other languages rather than Arabic. Under the Umayyads, Arabization/Islamization of these institutions picked up.

Under the Abbasids, a lot of officials were (descendants of) converts of Persian origin. The knowledge and skills they often brought with them from Sassanid times didn’t outshine their status as non-Arab converts. They had to work twice as hard for half as much, it seems. (Some things never change.) They came to comprise part of a burgeoning middle class in Abbasid urban centers from the 9th century onward, which also included religious scholars, merchants, and other white-collar workers. People with Persian roots were everywhere, really, and marginalization on those grounds led to a spate of intellectual writing in Persian in the 10th century.

> *shu’ubiyya*: from *shu’ub*, meaning “peoples,” “nations.” A cultural and literary movement in response to the privileged status of Arab everything; a call for equality among Muslim peoples regardless of background.

The Barmakid family came from Persian and Buddhist origins (specifically, around Balkh, in central Asia) and made a huge impact both in their own efforts in through their patronage of the arts, science, and architecture. They were closely connected with the Abbasids and served the first five caliphs in various positions, from tutoring princes to directing the mint. During their time, the Barmakids also formed the **vizierate**, serving as trusted advisors as well as competent administrators.

> *vizierate*: the office of the **vizier**, the head of the bureaucracy under the caliph.
