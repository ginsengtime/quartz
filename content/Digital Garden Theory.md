  - federated wikis — social information/info "de-streamed"

> the excitement here is in building complexity, not reducing it

collecting/connecting information NOT for the sake of an argument (initially) but, more importantly, to develop more nuanced understanding

  - the garden as both a microcosm of the world you met and a mirror of the self
  - emergent behaviors of information? can complex information networks exhibit surprising emergent qualities? ... did i just rediscover A.I. and
    machine learning oops :P

nice

> our survival as a species depends on us getting past the sweet, salty fat of “the web as  conversation” and on to something more timeless, integrative, iterative, something less personal and less self-assertive, something more solitary yet more connected

Um I'm a bit suspicious of this bit. I think the web as conversation is a perfectly fine way of doing things, though the current form of conversation predominant on the Web today is pretty superficial sometimes. I think his idea is... what, people intentionally sharing their personal study notes and being better for it? But what good are those personal connections if we cannot converse about them? perhaps i'm misunderstanding.

> The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another. (bernstein)

did someone say "[[web as space]]?"

resist
all u want but Stream-modeled experiences (twitter,fb,most social
media) is going to sweep you away. shit's a temporal rather than spatial
experience (relate to native/indigenous conceptions of place vs time)

  - READ: Vannevar Bush "As We May Think" (1945)
  - Memex = commonplace book lowkey. collating copies of annotatable info
    relevant to your own interests and studies + your own notes? that's
    literally a commonplace aid bye
  - losing my mind suddenly realizing these folks are all just chasing commonplace books \*wheeze\*
