title: "Re-embodying Ourselves"
---

- Quality of attention =/= time on task. Perform grounding exercises that 	center sensory experiences to bring attention to the body and self.
- Silence and mindfulness practice â€” not just in meditation sessions (why must we "set aside" time for our minds?) but as a part of our daily embodied existence.
- Welcoming alternative sensory ways of knowing: food, music, movement. How can you reclaim your body as an agent of learning and experience?
