title: "Jesus in Islam"
---
Jesus, known in Arabic as 'Isa ibn Maryam ('Isa, son of Mary), is the penultimate prophet in Muslim tradition. While the Qur'an says he was born of a virgin, performed miracles, etc., it also asserts that he is not a son of God. He was, however, miraculously saved by God and ascended to Heaven â€” i.e., he wasn't crucified and did not die on the cross. He is revered in Sufism (read up on this).
