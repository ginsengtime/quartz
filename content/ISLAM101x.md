> _I'm taking an edX online course on Arab-Islamic history because I've always been interested in it. It's taught via pre-recorded video lectures conducted by Dr. Miri Shefer-Mossensohn of Tel Aviv University.  
> I'll keep general notes here and link to more detailed notes throughout. I hope to read some supplemental texts to get a better idea of the subject matter, too. If anything here is way off-base, please let me know. Also, I'm not a member of any religion, although [[I'm uhhh vaguely spiritual, you know]]?_
