> Our mind is constantly thinking, our eyes perceiving screens or books, our ears listening, and our mouths speaking. Yet, what about those other parts of our bodies: stomach, chest, shoulders, legs, knees, backs, and so on? Amid deadlines and reviews,these non-productive parts of our bodies are rendered invisible.

Shahjahan calls on us to be "lazy" and "slow down."

  - Lazy  
    being at peace with not doing or not being productive. Divesting ourselves from the need for some result over some time.
  - Slowing Down  
    building relationships and connections \> production. Acceptance of and allowance for ambiguity, uncertainty of outcomes.

> With the introduction of the clock, time was delinked from human bodies, and human bodies from nature.

When was the last time I went a day without looking at a clock? Sleep, meals, exercise — essential activities to our livelihood and health have been de-prioritized in favor of time. We make time to eat between meetings, stay up far too late to finish a project. Western notions of linear, immutable [[time]] have severed the link between humans and the natural cycles of which we are but one small part, no matter how late we stay up staring at our screens.

We need to [[re-embody]] ourselves: re-center our awareness on our bodies, our physical wellbeing, and our presence in space.

> The proper use of time has become a measure of moral character.

"Wasting time" has become a mark of immorality, of not-enough-ness. You're lazy, so you don't deserve... Shahjahan writes within academia, where professors and students alike are plagued by the pressure to "be productive" and use their time in ways deemed acceptable, so as to maintain their standing in their communities. However, this pressure often marginalizes/excludes persons with different needs and abilities, as well as those who experience time and progress differently from the linear model Eurocentric time requires.

> ... time is an epistemic tool through which a chronology of difference was created by colonial logic. Time became a trajectory against which to measure indigenous and other subaltern individuals and groups in terms of the degree to which they are out of sync, behind in development, anachronistic, and resistant to progress.

The hegemony of linear time has been used time and again as a justification for colonialism: indigenous people are "lesser" because they aren't "as far along," and so they must be uplifted and brought up to speed. This colonial logic of time has invaded our personal lives — we aren't keeping up with other people our age, we aren't being progressive or innovative in our usage of time, etc.
