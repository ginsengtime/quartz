title: "Umayyad caliphate"
---
The era following the [[Rashidun]]. Lasted 661–750.

Emerged from the [[First]] [[Fitna]] which had started with 'Uthman's assassination in 656. It lasted until 661, when [[Mu'awiya bin Abi Sufyan]] became caliph. With this, the hands that held power shifted from those of the [[Sahaba]] to those of the elite. Which honestly is a weird slap in the face to literally everyone, since Mu'awiya is one of the Quraysh, who [[drove Muhammad out of Mecca]] in the first place? But go off, I guess.

The rest of Mu'awiya's reign was relatively peaceful. His death in 680, however, sparked the [[Second Fitna]]. Yet again, the marginalized tribes on the fringes were raring to fight. And once again, Muslims within the budding empire (? society? what's a good word) were feeling alienated. This time, it was non-Arab Muslims who felt disenfranchised in relation to Arab-Muslims and their elite ruling class. Also, the Umayyads had set up shop in Damascus, establishing a central seat of political power in the Levant while Mecca and Medina (and their elites) clung to religious clout. Yikes on bikes, babes. And in fact, the Umayyads besieged Mecca TWICE, which was a very bad look. I mean, bringing arms to the holiest place in your religion? You can see why historians didn't look very favorably on the Umayyads.

That's not to say they were all bad. As architects of the early Muslim state, they took a lot of steps to consolidate power and solidify Muslim religious and political (self-?)identity. They minted coins\! Established bureaucratic centers\! Made Arabic the main language of regional trade\! Commissioned grand buildings and directed estates\! ...Not that that helped their image much. Both contemporary sources and those of the subsequent [[Abbasid caliphate]] (which probably had a vested interest in talking themselves up versus the old regime) were highly critical of the Umayyads. They were secular, they were despotic, their rule didn't last long and *you know whyyy? \*shakes fist\** I guess you can pour all the money you want into statecraft, but if you're gonna do a lot of stuff counter to the religion that forms the bedrock of the state, people aren't gonna like you. Go figure.

  - Islamic Golden Age – this is what I am really curious about. I've been wanting to learn about the Golden Age for... ages. Astronomy, math, history/historiography, political and social sciences – so many huge leaps and bounds in this era and beyond\! I wonder how this political context influenced the scientific and artistic achievements of the Golden Age.
  - Mu'awiya had a long history before his ascension. I want to learn about it.
