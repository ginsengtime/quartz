- **suburban retrofitting**: reimagining of suburban structures into spaces more relevant to the community's needs

The shift toward one- to two-person households means the suburban sprawl of the past is no longer meeting the needs of the people who live there now.

> The expectation going forward is that something like 80 percent of new households that will form over the next 15 years will be these one to two person households. A lot of them would prefer an apartment or a condo—smaller units.

Empty nesters also prefer smaller spaces in a community setting to vast neighborhoods and lawns. Moreover, where the suburbs once housed people who commuted to the city to work, that trend has reversed in recent years.

Benefits of these new "third spaces" include community bonding, physical design (encourages people to move), and revitalization of local spaces — along with all the health benefits thereof. They can also be tools for social equity and access by providing a platform or outlet for cultural events, practices, and showcases that otherwise would go unseen.

This reminds me of the Crosstown Concourse in Memphis, although I'd hesitate to say it has a focus on social equity. Its target market seem to be the young adults pouring into southern cities like Memphis in search of authenticity or just cheap housing. Many of the stores seem out of the price range of the average Memphian, and although I'm not up to date on their events calendar, I don't know if it's aimed at uplifting those who need it.

However, on reviewing the [Mixed-Use Development Case Study conducted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in May 2020](https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/Section-108-Case-Study-Crosstown-Concourse.pdf), it seems that on the employment side of things they're doing okay. A minimum of 20% of the units are allocated to affordable housing — low in my opinion, but maybe they'll up that in the future.

> Moreover, this development brought additional essential services to the Midtown area. In particular, Crosstown includes a YMCA as well a new public charter high school and several healthcare centers targeted to serve LMI individuals.

Aww, it's also LEED certified! <3
