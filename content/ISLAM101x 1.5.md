title: "ISLAM101x 1.5 Muhammad - The Community Leader"
---
Muhammad was both a political and religious leader. The scattered tribal groups and polities found (eveeentually) a single leader in Muhammad, mirroring the unity of God and the authority over the world that He created.

Unified, central states were [[already known]] through surrounding empires; monotheism was already present in the forms of Judaism and Christianity. So what innovations did Muhammad bring? He implemented *both* of these in the tribal Arabian context — he embodied political and religious authority in one person. As a result, acknowledgment of Muhammad's political authority (known as [[Bayca]]) was also considered conversion to Islam.

Muhammad is considered the last and best of the monotheistic prophets, and a perfect human being — **not** divine like [[Jesus]] is to Christians. He did not perform miracles; the Qur'an and all it entails were not created by him but revealed to him.

The negotiations and Treaty of Hudaybiyya are very important both in Islam and in illustrating Muhammad's multifaceted leadership. After a dream of performing the [[Umrah]] (pilgrimage), Muhammad led a group of Muslims to Mecca. On their way, they were stopped by Qurayshi emissaries in Hudaybiyya. Long negotiations led to a treaty that seemed at first to be solely concessions — it made no acknowledgment of Muhammad's leadership or status as the prophet. However\! It ended up great for Madina.

  - Muhammad and the pilgrims could still enter Mecca a year later.
  - Muhammad could use the following year to strengthen his forces; indeed, he took Mecca in 630.
  - During negotiations, Muhammad learned that the Byzantines had defeated the Sassanids, whose Shah had been killed and replaced by his daughter. Their local collaborators, the Jews in Khaybar, were now weakened and could be brought down.

Lastly, yes, there was conflict with the Jews. Muhammad's request for them to come and acknowledge him in the peninsula was rebuked. But tensions were political and commercial, not just religious. Wealthy Jewish merchants and artisans meant many Jewish tribes — as well as polytheist Arab tribes — had to be removed (expelled or otherwise) in the road to unification.

Muhammad's death in 632 did not come with an appointment of an heir, which triggered a succession crisis.
