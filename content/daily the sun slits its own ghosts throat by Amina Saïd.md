**daily the sun slits its own ghost’s throat**  
and rises in blood

each beginning draws a circle  
memory leads to the sea of beginnings  
the pier is made of stone the tree of exile  
I aspire to the horizon

on a thread of light  
I move towards the place that is you  
and what had been happens  

a star dances on my forehead’s sky  
the bird within us is reborn from the soul’s shore  
your word is yours mine is my word

you return to the place that I am  
and the poem continues to write itself

I see your face and the shadow on your face  
like the poem suffering is shared  
we share the grief of the tree of the too-brief  
seasons and of the exile from seasons  
of the smiles and the rifts of the earth  
of men’s misfortune of women’s prayers

as we would wish the instant takes its dazzled form  
time blurs over like a landscape  
we live the two halves of our lives  
like a journey that will perhaps remember  
the names of islands birds ports  
of the white wake of boats cities beings  
of the cycle of arrivals and departures

and we fall in love with night  
because each night celebrates a dream’s wedding  
and we fall in love with day  
because life begins with each day
