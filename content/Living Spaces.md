title: "Living Spaces"
---
Spaces touched by the living become, themselves, alive. That applies to [[Spatial Tech|technology]] as well as physical spaces. They can — and many would argue *should be* — designed with a clear **form**, **intent**, and **purpose**. But like many arts, free of the creator's hand or drawing board they become what people make of them. In [[The People the Suburbs Were Built for Are Gone|the suburbs]] parking lots and shopping malls find new life as cultural centers and gathering spaces. User interfaces may follow [[Intimacy Gradient and Other Lessons from Architecture|architectural cues]] to create a [[Screen As Room|room-like experience]]. On the flip side, hostile spaces (not just hostile architecture) are not an uncommon theme in media from *The Haunting of Hill House* to *House of Leaves*. [[Control, Anatomy, and the Legacy of the Haunted House|What haunts a house without ghosts]]?
