## Page Notes


## Highlights
- high level of MSP — [Updated on 2022-01-04 09:44:28](https://hyp.is/eP6gaGz3EeynOT82-i6__Q/www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/1/2/its-time-to-take-indias-farmers-protest-to-the-west)  — 

   - Annotation: I'm not an economist so this is only a guess, but do high MSPs lead to higher selling prices to Western buyers? Why else would they be complaining?
But that's ridiculous, because if they remove subsidies, then so many smaller farmers will suffer -- it's not sustainable...- The infrastructure of developing nations simply does not support the creation of similar social policies.

- India will have to import – and here is where the interest of Canada, the US and Australia lies. — [Updated on 2022-01-04 09:45:35](https://hyp.is/oOeRIGz3EeyvQifLH-hWgA/www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/1/2/its-time-to-take-indias-farmers-protest-to-the-west)  — 

   - Annotation: ohhhh. hate it here- The South Asian nation with a population 1.3 billion is a highly lucrative market for these Western countries. To capture it, they seem to be perpetuating neocolonial policies, with the WTO serving as a new East India Company. — [Updated on 2022-01-04 09:45:44](https://hyp.is/pjuZlmz3EeynxCfKuCFt0w/www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/1/2/its-time-to-take-indias-farmers-protest-to-the-west)  —
