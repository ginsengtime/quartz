It is exactly the way you would feel if a beautiful, silent turbine whirled beside you day and night, protecting you, driving you on, coursing with current, fiercely bladed, devoted. God, it’s love. It’s love I can’t explain. It’s cold and good. — [Updated on 2021-07-02 07:42:43](https://hyp.is/peYMvtq9Eeuoz4OKHpoBKA/archive.is/2020.01.01-232918/http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/fall_01_20/)  — Group: #Public

   - Annotation: again- if your body-fact is enough to establish your gender, you would willingly wear bright dresses and cry at movies, wouldn’t you?
