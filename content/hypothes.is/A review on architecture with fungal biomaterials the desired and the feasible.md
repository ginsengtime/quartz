## Page Notes


## Highlights
- architects can explore the ‘growth algorithms’ of such structures and translate or simulate them with the use of digital tools into intelligent designs and resilient urban infrastructures — [Updated on 2022-05-27 10:58:27](https://hyp.is/gCJS8t1gEeyg4Gsr8y1e3w/fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-021-00124-5)  — 

   - Annotation: I'd be interested to read up on some ways hyphae function as models for such designs and infrastructures. Makes me think of the slime mold experiment that mirrored the Tokyo subway system.- hempcrete — [Updated on 2022-05-27 10:59:41](https://hyp.is/rBIaMt1gEeyg4uszi-I10A/fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-021-00124-5)  — 

- After the exhibition, the bricks were shredded and dispersed on soil. 60 days later they were degraded — [Updated on 2022-05-27 11:00:09](https://hyp.is/vKY2Tt1gEey0ZGf73qhaaA/fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-021-00124-5)  — 

   - Annotation: I wonder what ecological impact they have when they degrade! :)- the creators of this pavilion have published an accompanying ‘Material Atlas’, which catalogues the life-cycle analyses of the materials used and details the fabrication, and treatment processes that were applied for the result — [Updated on 2022-05-27 11:03:31](https://hyp.is/NWUiUt1hEeyy8UPLVm-rHQ/fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-021-00124-5)  — 

- many architectural approaches follow a modular logic of bricks or panels of mycelial composites — [Updated on 2022-05-27 11:06:11](https://hyp.is/lHXyqN1hEeyqy2MaxXXSbQ/fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-021-00124-5)  — 

   - Annotation: Which sorta makes sense, since mycelial growth may alter the form -> structural instability in a monolith or other structure that has larger, less uniform components- compression-based structural geometries are preferred due to the mechanical properties of the mycelial composite — [Updated on 2022-05-27 11:06:57](https://hyp.is/r_xjXt1hEeyCZbe0x8nd_w/fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-021-00124-5)  — 

- living material has properties that could offer new active properties such as self-healing, self-repairing, and partial self-organization — [Updated on 2022-05-27 11:07:21](https://hyp.is/vkpD1t1hEey4Sjciavs-1g/fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-021-00124-5)  — 

- alternative paradigm to the state of the art of “intelligent buildings”, which rely heavily on technical infrastructures — [Updated on 2022-05-27 11:08:52](https://hyp.is/9H5FnN1hEeyCZqdnyzROQw/fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-021-00124-5)  —
