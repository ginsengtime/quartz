## Page Notes


## Highlights
- English shapes its speakers as powerfully as any other language. It’s just that in an anglophone world, that invisible baggage is harder to discern. — [Updated on 2022-01-21 14:46:09](https://hyp.is/by_GCnp9EeyeoPvDOVk41w/www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/27/english-language-global-dominance)  — 

   - Annotation: Kind of like how if everyone around you has the same dialect, you don't consider it a dialect.- despite its influence, English is not truly universal. Its horizons are just as limited as those of any other language — [Updated on 2022-01-21 14:46:22](https://hyp.is/drIO9np9EeyZXcMnxRiJZQ/www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/27/english-language-global-dominance)  — 

- one aspect of speaking Kayardild, then, is learning that the landscape is more important and objective than you are. Kayardild grammar literally puts everyone in their place. — [Updated on 2022-01-21 14:47:41](https://hyp.is/gFNgQHp9EeykObtBp4BvFQ/www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/27/english-language-global-dominance)  — 

   - Annotation: It makes me reflect on spatial assumptions in Japanese... what are they?- To speak only English, in spite of its vast vocabulary and countless varieties, is still to dwell in a rather small pool. It draws the same circle Humboldt described around its speakers as each of the other 6,000 human languages. The difference is that we have mistaken that circle for the world. — [Updated on 2022-01-21 14:47:53](https://hyp.is/rS59enp9EeyLJUNRPxEAbg/www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/27/english-language-global-dominance)  — 

- “If I meet an English person, and he says, ‘I write in English,’ I don’t ask him, ‘Why are you writing in English?’ If I meet a French writer, I don’t ask him, ‘Why don’t you write in Vietnamese?’ But I am asked over and over again, ‘Why do you write in Gikuyu?’ For Africans, the view is there is something wrong about writing in an African language.” — [Updated on 2022-01-21 14:48:12](https://hyp.is/uDBEfnp9Eeyc7otLAqNgMQ/www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/27/english-language-global-dominance)  — 

- The last fragments of Nansemond, once spoken in eastern Virginia, were collected from the last living speaker just before his death in 1902, by which time he could only recall six words: one, two, three, four, five and dog. — [Updated on 2022-01-21 14:48:32](https://hyp.is/xKN4tnp9EeyeoselXAk8sQ/www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/27/english-language-global-dominance)  — 

   - Annotation: this really breaks my heart.- The great Malian historian and novelist Amadou Hampâté Bâ once said that in Africa, when an elder dies, a library burns. Today, across the world, the libraries are still burning. — [Updated on 2022-01-21 14:48:44](https://hyp.is/xzhHKHp9Eeylak9EIYsSRg/www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/27/english-language-global-dominance)  —

- All the forces of modernity, globalisation, industrialisation, urbanisation and the rise of the nation-state are arrayed against the small and local as opposed to the big and shareable. — [Updated on 2022-01-21 14:49:28](https://hyp.is/5Y8FpHp9EeyPTZ8vpVXHxw/www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/27/english-language-global-dominance)  — 

- Humankind, as imagined by the academy, is mostly anglophone. — [Updated on 2022-01-21 14:50:15](https://hyp.is/AaVNrHp-Eey1lWM4KDfvFw/www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/27/english-language-global-dominance)  — 

   - Annotation: The worldview inherent in the language -> the worldview inherent in the science -> the worldview inherent in academia- “It wouldn’t be any good if we talked the same; we like to know where people come from.” It’s a vision of Babel in reverse. Instead of representing a fall from human perfection, as in the biblical story, having many languages is a gift. — [Updated on 2022-01-21 14:50:43](https://hyp.is/EkLSnHp-Eey5XUdQ9PaBaA/www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/27/english-language-global-dominance)  —
