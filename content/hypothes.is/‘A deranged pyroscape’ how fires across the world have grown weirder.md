## Page Notes


## Highlights
- We used to burn what grew around us, with effects largely limited to our own day. Now we excavate plant matter from the deep past, burn it in the present, and send its byproducts wafting into an uncertain future. — [Updated on 2022-02-07 13:40:47](https://hyp.is/Ho30qofQEey3P9tPRAQR8w/www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/03/a-deranged-pyroscape-how-fires-across-the-world-have-grown-weirder)  — Group: #Public

- When we think of how humanity is kindling fires, we think of global heating, which is the sum of our energy use in general. Our “burning planet” becomes an existential crisis, linked to modernity, rather than one tied to any specific company, activity or governmental scheme. And we think mainly of how fire affects the affluent people whose property is at stake, rather than the poor people whose lives are. — [Updated on 2022-02-07 13:43:54](https://hyp.is/jarDDofQEey-WB_RwCuXYA/www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/03/a-deranged-pyroscape-how-fires-across-the-world-have-grown-weirder)  — Group: #Public
