## Highlights
- as we’ve grown more adept at using the internet, we’ve also grown more adept at destroying people’s lives, but from a distance, in an abstracted way. — [Updated on 2021-07-02 07:30:42](https://hyp.is/-KSMINq7Eeu2QVv95CHTXQ/www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)  — 

- Sometimes, the path to your personal hell is paved with other people’s best intentions.  — [Updated on 2021-07-02 07:30:45](https://hyp.is/-jHebNq7EeuXav85vhWdEA/www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)  —

   - Annotation: OF COURSE- That gap — between the good-faith anonymity assumed in trans spaces and the bad-faith anonymity increasingly assumed online — was the one Fall wandered into.  — [Updated on 2021-07-02 08:28:37](https://hyp.is/D4wamtrEEeug89Psx2l3tw/www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)  — 

- gender as an innate part of the self, gender as a performance for society, and gender as a (literal) weapon of the state — [Updated on 2021-07-02 08:29:06](https://hyp.is/IQJJcNrEEeuO5LevAGN_GA/www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)  — 

- if all gender is on some level a performance (and it is), then it can be co-opted and perverted by the state. But if it’s also innate on some level (and it is), then we are powerless against whatever it is that enough people decide gender performance should look like. We are constantly trapped by gender, even when we know we are trapped by it. You can’t truly escape something so all-pervasive; you can only negotiate your own terms with it, and everybody’s terms are different. — [Updated on 2021-07-02 08:30:34](https://hyp.is/VTscdtrEEeuSy0suIkxyhg/www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)  — 

- Framing matters. After the frame around the story was in place, it could not be shaken, and everything that happened afterwards was influenced by it — [Updated on 2021-07-02 23:08:27](https://hyp.is/-PdULNs-Eeu6xVcqcK6mcA/www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)  — 

   - Annotation: I said this exact thing in discussing this story with a friend. Framing the story in a war zone applies the lens of violence to all the gender critique/commentary - Most of all, I wanted people to say, ‘This story was written by a woman who understands being a woman.’ I obviously failed horribly — [Updated on 2021-07-02 23:12:25](https://hyp.is/hxQV9ts_EeuYaROzHEalWA/www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)  — 

   - Annotation: idk as a cis woman i was very touched by the story but *shrugs* a lot of the criticism from the trans community is valid- A paranoid reading focuses on what’s wrong or problematic about a work of art. A reparative reading seeks out what might be nourishing or healing in a work of art, even if the work is flawed. Importantly, a reparative reading also tends to consider what might be nourishing or healing in a work of art for someone who isn’t the reader.  — [Updated on 2021-07-02 23:14:18](https://hyp.is/ygK6NNs_EeuOQg_KPu6ghA/www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)  — 

- Part of reparative reading is trying to think about how a story cannot do everything. Nothing can do everything. If you’re reading every text, fiction, or criticism looking for it to tick a bunch of boxes — like if it represents X, Y, and Z appropriately to my definitions of appropriate, and if it’s missing any of those things, it’s not good — you’re not really seeing the close focus that it has on something else — [Updated on 2021-07-02 23:16:59](https://hyp.is/KlAnFNtAEeuW9BsKZNsPkA/www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)  — 

   - Annotation: It's interesting bc you could do a paranoid reading from the same perspective? As in it ticks a bunch of "good" boxes for you but you look at the problematic ways in which it presents other things...- The sheer assault of information on Twitter makes it difficult to parse, and unlike other social networks, it doesn’t really have elements that preserve any semblance of context — [Updated on 2021-07-02 23:18:07](https://hyp.is/UpBeLttAEeuYaydZu4N9jA/www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)  — 

   - Annotation: right—a feed or nexus of discussion is very decentralized, in a way, in that if something isn't hashtagged it's not placed in any context by the algorithm. searching can only do so much to collate similar tweet (thread)s.- But Twitter is a platform that rewards divisive opinions, which are more likely to drive engagement — [Updated on 2021-07-02 23:18:19](https://hyp.is/WfAFmNtAEeuhuCcjad6yxg/www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)  — 

- much of that discussion was pretty evenly split between paranoid and reparative readings, — [Updated on 2021-07-02 23:19:30](https://hyp.is/ftkB3ttAEeuszfeCc_96kw/www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)  — 

   - Annotation: i wanna hear these different readings bc an enby friend was critical of the story's framing of gender through the lens of violence- like all weapons, it will do the most damage when aimed at the least defended, the isolated, those with no one to stand up for them, publicly or privately. And we must be careful with the temptation to use it inside our own houses to destroy shapes we think are intruders — [Updated on 2021-07-02 23:24:33](https://hyp.is/OH5b1NtBEeu1aJNQNZHffg/www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)  —
