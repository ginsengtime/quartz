## Page Notes


## Highlights
- The point is less whether renewable energy automatically equals a fairer society, and more that the massive infrastructural changes ahead provide leverage to institute something better. — [Updated on 2021-06-11 09:12:03](https://hyp.is/pm6CMMpJEeurgF__9x5OjQ/lareviewofbooks.org/article/solarpunk-against-a-shitty-future/)  — 

- Solarpunk is about “ingenuity, generativity, independence, and community” — the last of which is of particular interest — and rightly sees “infrastructure as a form of resistance.” — [Updated on 2021-06-11 09:12:21](https://hyp.is/sPCEQspJEeumA4eZ_sWhCg/lareviewofbooks.org/article/solarpunk-against-a-shitty-future/)  — 

- Solarpunk: an energy culture that serves as a platform for experiments in being, rather than a closure of it. — [Updated on 2021-06-11 09:12:58](https://hyp.is/xswePspJEeu8t2PeD_My4g/lareviewofbooks.org/article/solarpunk-against-a-shitty-future/)  — 

- magic in Earthsea, and in Solarpunk, is not only about the human; it’s clearly about the human in communion with the environment. — [Updated on 2021-06-11 09:14:10](https://hyp.is/8eM8QspJEeuViJMgMRjLwA/lareviewofbooks.org/article/solarpunk-against-a-shitty-future/)  — 

- To think about a renewable future we currently draw on fantastical modes that are at least partly entrenched in pre-modern aesthetics and structures — this mode of thinking is a “forward looking memory,” perhaps, but it is also problematic because of its pastoral or nostalgic nature. — [Updated on 2021-06-11 09:15:20](https://hyp.is/G3A_LspKEeu9QytsMgs9oQ/lareviewofbooks.org/article/solarpunk-against-a-shitty-future/)  — 

   - Annotation: Problematic in that we refuse to entertain possible pitfalls in the pursuit of this future, I suppose- The fact that there is no abject, no excrement, in Solarpunk belies a sinister omission. A different value system would likely change the abject rather than rid us of it. — [Updated on 2021-06-11 09:16:57](https://hyp.is/VafxPMpKEeuqIkdDVytebA/lareviewofbooks.org/article/solarpunk-against-a-shitty-future/)  — 

   - Annotation: I wonder what exactly this means; I feel like solarpunk imaginaries emphasize reuse and re/upcycling of waste, and inclusivity of humans, so I'm curious what they mean. I do think that people who are at odds with societal values are often maligned tho- But there is the attendant danger that the energy transition be treated as a given, a narrative necessity for the platforming of politics grounded in identity, while the actual rough politics required to make that transition happen in the first place fades into the background of the celebration. — [Updated on 2021-06-11 09:18:47](https://hyp.is/lwD7dMpKEeulU0ey6E_aLQ/lareviewofbooks.org/article/solarpunk-against-a-shitty-future/)  — 

   - Annotation: Isn't this the danger of any aesthetic-political movement? Solarpunk is at least grappling w these issues, on some levels. But if we want solarpunk to gain traction as more than a nebulous aesthetic or ~vibe~ we must be more intentional about centering landback and other reclamatory movements
