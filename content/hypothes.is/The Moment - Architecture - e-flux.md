## Page Notes


## Highlights
- the future of museums rests on dynamic income generation beyond traditional government funding — [Updated on 2022-02-16 09:37:29](https://hyp.is/nwJpbI7AEeyyyodr2IrAXg/www.e-flux.com/architecture/solicited-proposals/449302/the-moment/)  — Group: #Public

   - Annotation: and it's strangling us T_T- The “moment” is the immersive installation; the spatial void; the refractive mirror; the sonic interaction. — [Updated on 2022-02-17 08:24:15](https://hyp.is/jrPELo9_Eey4Mc-LC4cUkQ/www.e-flux.com/architecture/solicited-proposals/449302/the-moment/)  — Group: #Public

   - Annotation: Any overarching commentary by which the "moment" is motivated is so often overshadowed by perception and desire to share it- the “moment.” It is the climax to the exhibition journey: it is when mediated emotion, immersion, and sensory stimulation converge, with multi-modal flows of image, sound, object, text, and spatial dynamics conjuring an enveloping and transcendental experience. — [Updated on 2022-02-17 08:24:36](https://hyp.is/mruYgo9_Eey6OTvbufTtZw/www.e-flux.com/architecture/solicited-proposals/449302/the-moment/)  — Group: #Public

- quantify the success of institutions in a highly bureaucratized process of financial security.1  — [Updated on 2022-02-17 08:24:44](https://hyp.is/oAb8ZI9_Eeyv_RN-4rVV_Q/www.e-flux.com/architecture/solicited-proposals/449302/the-moment/)  — Group: #Public

- this notion of a scenography or “set”—as opposed to a build that responds primarily to a linear route around the gallery or between objects—positions the gallery as a space of performance in which visitors were on the receiving end of a show. — [Updated on 2022-02-17 08:29:42](https://hyp.is/5RAI5o9_EeyxkbvxZKfCrg/www.e-flux.com/architecture/solicited-proposals/449302/the-moment/)  — Group: #Public

   - Annotation: Does this take some agency from visitors? Instead of (or on top of) provoking critical thought about the gallery's contents, it's more about consumption.- the conditions of the site — [Updated on 2022-02-17 08:30:19](https://hyp.is/ZznXeo-AEey5uLtgkOTO5Q/www.e-flux.com/architecture/solicited-proposals/449302/the-moment/)  — Group: #Public

   - Annotation: maybe this is specific vocabulary... site? as in the physical location of the gallery?- what if instead of creating these compartmentalizing “moments” in the gallery—where visitors are beckoned into their phones, or where not all bodies can engage—our ability to experience questions raised by an exhibition was installed in some other way, as an atmosphere throughout the entire gallery?  — [Updated on 2022-02-17 08:30:39](https://hyp.is/c1UMUI-AEeyk0gNQX1qmgw/www.e-flux.com/architecture/solicited-proposals/449302/the-moment/)  — Group: #Public

- The colonial and extractive histories that foreground the idea of the museum—and the dispossessed collections on which many of these institutions are constructed—are obliterated through the curatorial practice of being immersed “elsewhere,” removing visitors in an otherworldly “moment.” — [Updated on 2022-02-17 08:31:10](https://hyp.is/hbvBGI-AEeyhD3umF-N16w/www.e-flux.com/architecture/solicited-proposals/449302/the-moment/)  — Group: #Public

- architecture was welcome in the museum gallery so long as it agreed to these, or similar, representational conventions and declined, quite simply, to be architecture.” — [Updated on 2022-02-17 08:34:54](https://hyp.is/C3wwlI-BEeygskNwhGnE4A/www.e-flux.com/architecture/solicited-proposals/449302/the-moment/)  — Group: #Public

   - Annotation: everyone wants to redesign the exhibit but who's tryna redesign the room- Architecture can be revived in the museum in meaningful and powerful ways. As a discipline concerned primarily with facilitating how space can be shared, its innate qualities overlap with traditional notions of the museum: a place to meet with others, challenge one’s assumptions, and expand horizons. — [Updated on 2022-02-17 08:39:42](https://hyp.is/txmchI-BEeyeMWMw9pRqQg/www.e-flux.com/architecture/solicited-proposals/449302/the-moment/)  — Group: #Public

   - Annotation: Consider: expanding the scope/mission of a museum exhibit from curating a collection and a way to enjoy it to curating a collection and a space for it -- and people (not persons) -- to be in (words aren't working today)
