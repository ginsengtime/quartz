## Page Notes


## Highlights
- Although each agreement was distinct, in recent years an important pattern has emerged of conservationists and Indigenous people working together by way of land transfers. The effect has been twofold: protecting ecologically vital spaces while helping to right historic injustices by returning properties to their original caretakers. — [Updated on 2022-01-04 09:03:01](https://hyp.is/ruMrgmzxEeyYNBO-SiAM9Q/www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/original-caretakers-indigenous-groups-team-up-with-conservationists-to-protect-swaths-of-us)  — Group: #Public

   - Annotation: Collaborations between Indigenous communities and conservation groups is so important! First touched on this idea in *As Long As Grass Grows* (Dina Gilio-Whitaker)- Although Indigenous peoples make up only about 5% of the world’s population, their territories encompass 80% of global biodiversity, according to the 2020 report The Indigenous World. — [Updated on 2022-01-04 09:03:59](https://hyp.is/0Yf-7GzxEeyZAff7ZabYTg/www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/original-caretakers-indigenous-groups-team-up-with-conservationists-to-protect-swaths-of-us)  — Group: #Public

   - Annotation: I feel like whaling is such a touchy subject nowadays. I support the international whale trade ban; whaling on a huge scale is what we need to avoid. However, in places such as northern Europe, Japan, and Indigenous communities where it is traditional and done sustainably, what's the problem?- given all the ignored treaties and other agreements cast aside, tribes have been left to take care of themselves. And in some cases that may mean logging, gaming, tourism or other practices that don’t necessarily align with conservation. — [Updated on 2022-01-04 09:09:39](https://hyp.is/nBh8hmzyEeya0xecmqHU8A/www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/original-caretakers-indigenous-groups-team-up-with-conservationists-to-protect-swaths-of-us)  — Group: #Public
