## Page Notes


## Highlights
- Humans, says Dennis-Tiwary, are ‘anti-fragile’ – we only strengthen and grow when challenged. ‘Our emotional systems are like our immune systems,’ she says. ‘If our immune system isn’t exposed to germs, it remains weak. If our muscles aren’t used, atrophy sets in. It’s only by feeling our anxiety, listening and acting on it that we cope better next time.’ — [Updated on 2022-05-09 11:23:57](https://hyp.is/FG2wss8_Eey14utUjgm64g/www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/07/anxiety-isnt-fun-but-can-be-healthy-facing-up-to-it-is-always-better-than-hiding)  —
