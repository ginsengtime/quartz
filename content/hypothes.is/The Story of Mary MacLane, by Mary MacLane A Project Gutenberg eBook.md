- I am convinced of this, for I am odd. I am distinctly original innately and in development. I have in me a quite unusual intensity of life. I can feel. I have a marvelous capacity for misery and for happiness. I am broad-minded. I am a genius. I am a philosopher of my own good peripatetic school. [2] I care neither for right nor for wrong—my conscience is nil. My brain is a conglomeration of aggressive versatility. I have reached a truly wonderful state of miserable morbid unhappiness. I know myself, oh, very well. I have attained an egotism that is rare indeed. I have gone into the deep shadows. All this constitutes oddity. I find, therefore, that I am quite, quite odd. — [Updated on 2020-06-18 09:03:27](https://hyp.is/IujMSLD3EeqF2aul3UZxcw/www.gutenberg.org/files/43696/43696-h/43696-h.htm)  — Group: #Public

   - Annotation: yo why tf she so funny. if she were alive today she'd do stand-up no cap- since nothing is of any moment in this world without the love of human beings for each other, it is a matter of supreme indifference to me whether my father, Jim MacLane of selfish memory, lived or died. — [Updated on 2020-06-18 09:09:28](https://hyp.is/-kawzrD3EeqQE0s3Cd6cGQ/www.gutenberg.org/files/43696/43696-h/43696-h.htm)  — Group: #Public
