## Page Notes


## Highlights
- How should we measure the effectiveness of a city (what are its KPIs) — [Updated on 2022-05-27 09:20:27](https://hyp.is/z3mvcN1SEey_ZV92IkCPlQ/placesjournal.org/article/a-city-is-not-a-computer/)  — 

   - Annotation: ahh, the many ways of looking at a city...- infrastructural nodes (known as “Links”) that may someday exchange data with autonomous vehicles, public transit, and other urban systems. — [Updated on 2022-05-27 09:23:48](https://hyp.is/RwHBmt1TEeykCpN9yepqzA/placesjournal.org/article/a-city-is-not-a-computer/)  — 

   - Annotation: for what purpose? who are these built for?? what sort of safeguards are in place to maintain privacy???- We’re transforming the idealized topology of the open web and Internet of Things into urban form.  — [Updated on 2022-05-27 09:26:54](https://hyp.is/tgcPKN1TEey_aU96JyhPAA/placesjournal.org/article/a-city-is-not-a-computer/)  — 

   - Annotation: and now everyone's talking about web3 and the bLoCkChAiN and DAO, all of which are so SO hot for surface-level libertarian opposition to capitalism that in its darkest corners is more capitalist than ever (my APES) - “As technical solutions to social problems, information and communications technologies encapsulate the promise of order over disarray … as a path to an emancipatory politics of modernity.” — [Updated on 2022-05-27 09:28:13](https://hyp.is/5TsUsN1TEeykDLNhsdtuZw/placesjournal.org/article/a-city-is-not-a-computer/)  — 

   - Annotation: it's the Enlightenment all over again- the processes of city-making are more complicated than writing parameters for rapid spatial optimization. — [Updated on 2022-05-27 09:29:25](https://hyp.is/D_D_lN1UEeyuw1NTBP6-Uw/placesjournal.org/article/a-city-is-not-a-computer/)  — 

- As Mumford understood, there is more than information processing going on here. Urban information is made, commodified, accessed, secreted, politicized, and operationalized. — [Updated on 2022-05-27 09:31:35](https://hyp.is/XWOFTt1UEeyxc-OXn1_6FA/placesjournal.org/article/a-city-is-not-a-computer/)  — 

   - Annotation: People live in cities! Things happen in cities! And the data that is produced in them are not always used for the good of either the people or the happenings within that space. Why else do protesters have to hide their faces?- whose interests it serves — [Updated on 2022-05-27 09:32:18](https://hyp.is/d1H1Jt1UEeyG03u1MJ6kSw/placesjournal.org/article/a-city-is-not-a-computer/)  — 

   - Annotation: who is using the computer?- our cities are full of fixed architectures, persistent terrains, and reliable environmental patterns that anchor all the unstructured data and image streams that float on top. — [Updated on 2022-05-27 09:34:38](https://hyp.is/yo9iZN1UEey6mgeXVT0iHg/placesjournal.org/article/a-city-is-not-a-computer/)  — 

- urban intelligence comes in multiple forms, that it is produced within environmental as well as cultural contexts, that it is reshaped over the longue durée by elemental exposure and urban development, that it can be lost or forgotten. — [Updated on 2022-05-27 09:35:27](https://hyp.is/56zu1N1UEey4LHMhNf--tA/placesjournal.org/article/a-city-is-not-a-computer/)  — 

   - Annotation: what is it with modern folks trying to jump into the computer like we don't have weather outside- In contemporary urban discourses, where “data” rhetoric is often frothy and fetishistic, we seem to have lost critical perspective on how urban data become meaningful spatial information or translate into place-based knowledge. — [Updated on 2022-05-27 09:39:04](https://hyp.is/aSRn7t1VEey6XCcs13sEOQ/placesjournal.org/article/a-city-is-not-a-computer/)  — 

   - Annotation: the evolution of data into info/knowledge -- something that can be understood and incorporated into larger (hopefully restorative? just?) citybuilding projects is blocked
