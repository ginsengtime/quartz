## Page Notes


## Highlights
- information itself, especially in the digital age, has nearly zero value because it requires little to no labour cost to reproduce — [Updated on 2020-12-20 06:55:09](https://hyp.is/3NA3mEJEEeuFGgfrM9bskA/readpassage.com/ip-monopolies-not-pirates-are-the-real-threat-to-artists/)  — Group: #Public
