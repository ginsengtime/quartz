## Page Notes


## Highlights
- My dictionary defines civilization as “the stage of human social development and organization that is considered most advanced.” Aside from being a sort of useless definition, this points out the prejudice inherent in civilization. It says: “We are advanced. You are primitive. What’s more, history and development is purely linear in nature, progress only moves forward, and any deviation from the course we are on is regressive.”  — [Updated on 2021-06-17 23:35:22](https://hyp.is/P0AwTM95EeuoTdPGEF81pg/theanarchistlibrary.org/library/margaret-killjoy-take-what-you-need-and-compost-the-rest-an-introduction-to-post-civilized-theo)  — 

   - Annotation: reminds me of Walker's connection btwn Eurocentric linear time, Darwinism, and the advanced-primitive dichotomy- We cannot, en masse, return to a pre-civilized way of life. And honestly, most of us don’t want to. We refuse a blanket rejection of everything that civilization has brought us. We need to look forward, not backwards.  — [Updated on 2021-06-17 23:37:48](https://hyp.is/ljAW7M95EeunOzv6TwfdPA/theanarchistlibrary.org/library/margaret-killjoy-take-what-you-need-and-compost-the-rest-an-introduction-to-post-civilized-theo)  — 

   - Annotation: Appropriate technology, diverse agricultural practices based on sustainability. Very solarpunk!- So moving towards post-civilization — with or without industrial collapse — is a matter of looking around oneself, one’s community, and one’s landbase, and determining what is appropriate. — [Updated on 2021-06-17 23:38:15](https://hyp.is/pm1Mqs95EeuXKgeUdhf3OQ/theanarchistlibrary.org/library/margaret-killjoy-take-what-you-need-and-compost-the-rest-an-introduction-to-post-civilized-theo)  — 

- But the borders between the groups will most likely be blurred, with individuals, groups, and families moving between social spheres. — [Updated on 2021-06-17 23:39:17](https://hyp.is/y19KuM95Eeu1dds97HKKRQ/theanarchistlibrary.org/library/margaret-killjoy-take-what-you-need-and-compost-the-rest-an-introduction-to-post-civilized-theo)  — 

   - Annotation: How do we maintain contact and "blurred" borders among groups?- Syndicalism is an economic system totally outside of the capitalist/state-socialist dichotomy. It suggests that a federation of collectivized trade unions might promote mutual aid between members. — [Updated on 2021-06-17 23:39:35](https://hyp.is/1jSOvM95Eeu8edMsHIEKBg/theanarchistlibrary.org/library/margaret-killjoy-take-what-you-need-and-compost-the-rest-an-introduction-to-post-civilized-theo)  — 

- Someone is going to wire up his Super Nintendo to a solar panel array, and folks from all walks of life are going to come over to play Street Fighter, or just to watch. We’re all going to grow most of our own food, and we’re all going to deal with our own trash, wash our own dishes.  — [Updated on 2021-06-17 23:40:28](https://hyp.is/9ZodMM95Eeu0gwNEbA0g5A/theanarchistlibrary.org/library/margaret-killjoy-take-what-you-need-and-compost-the-rest-an-introduction-to-post-civilized-theo)  — 

- It’s possible that the only question is which will collapse first: industrial civilization or the earth’s ability to sustain human life. — [Updated on 2021-06-17 23:41:05](https://hyp.is/C9ML8s96Eeu-HKvrANVbyw/theanarchistlibrary.org/library/margaret-killjoy-take-what-you-need-and-compost-the-rest-an-introduction-to-post-civilized-theo)  — 

- We tear up our lawns and leave only gardens. — [Updated on 2021-06-17 23:42:00](https://hyp.is/LGlI6s96Eeus_t962-o5tw/theanarchistlibrary.org/library/margaret-killjoy-take-what-you-need-and-compost-the-rest-an-introduction-to-post-civilized-theo)  —
