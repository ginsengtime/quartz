## Page Notes


## Highlights
- rhetorically personified and sentient houses, and between sentient houses and houses merely used as instruments by ghosts. — [Updated on 2022-05-27 08:31:58](https://hyp.is/CXQstt1MEey6QksTm4tzsw/docdrop.org/download_annotation_doc/project_muse_765255-lcc1h.pdf)  — 

-  A truly sentient house is one that has some kind of will of its own. It may not have human sen-tience but nevertheless displays a capacity to react to events and act according to an agenda of its own. — [Updated on 2022-05-27 08:39:45](https://hyp.is/H67-Vt1NEey6Rsv4KUrNjg/docdrop.org/download_annotation_doc/project_muse_765255-lcc1h.pdf)  — 

   - Annotation: Re: agendas, I think about the motivations a house could have. Loneliness? Rage? A desire to, purely and simply, Mess About?- It seems the tendency to anthropomorphize houses is ancient. — [Updated on 2022-05-27 08:40:49](https://hyp.is/RatTjt1NEeyfNiOjX4y5oA/docdrop.org/download_annotation_doc/project_muse_765255-lcc1h.pdf)  — 

   - Annotation: [*Jacob Geller voice* in Leviticus ... ](https://youtu.be/mexs39y0Imw)- Although computers cannot be intrinsically “evil” (unless so programmed), they can still “go crazy,”—malfunction, that is, which is what often happens in speculative fiction narratives,9 which belong to the broader theme of “technology going awry” rather than to the supernatural. — [Updated on 2022-05-27 08:42:53](https://hyp.is/j7N4xt1NEeymgTcjhVoWLQ/docdrop.org/download_annotation_doc/project_muse_765255-lcc1h.pdf)  — 

   - Annotation: Does it though? I feel like this line could be blurred in some spiritual sci-fi work. "Does this unit have a soul?" etc (NOT saying Mass Effect is necessarily spiritual, but stuff along those lines of AI that has spiritual depth)- Eventually, the family makes plans “to start repairs” and to “turn the old aban-doned home” into “a beautiful place” (116–17), and the house, which only wanted to be cared for and loved, is satisfied and stops haunting them. — [Updated on 2022-05-27 08:43:47](https://hyp.is/rUNY6N1NEeypSJ8eGK476Q/docdrop.org/download_annotation_doc/project_muse_765255-lcc1h.pdf)  — 

   - Annotation: there was a tumblr post about this- absolutely identical in every detail. — [Updated on 2022-05-27 08:49:31](https://hyp.is/QEQb5t1OEeyLmvvtM8FnWw/docdrop.org/download_annotation_doc/project_muse_765255-lcc1h.pdf)  — 

   - Annotation: The identical houses in *Dionaea House*, to me, were also in part a commentary on the sameness of suburban America. Is it, like the metonymical (I think I:m using that right) houses, eating us??- the house soon becomes sinister and threatening. — [Updated on 2022-05-27 08:49:36](https://hyp.is/_G9gGt1NEey4FM93s3Ud1Q/docdrop.org/download_annotation_doc/project_muse_765255-lcc1h.pdf)  — 

   - Annotation: There are a few contrasting takes on this, such as that the house -- in a heavy-handed sort of way -- is trying to please its occupants: it connects the parents' and children's bedrooms, it gives Navidson a place to explore right in his own home. But everyone is so thrown by, you know, *a house doing these things* that they take it in bad faith.- Are we meant to infer from this that the house can only influence inhabitants with some kind of vulnerability, such as a couple in a dysfunctional relationship? — [Updated on 2022-05-27 08:50:42](https://hyp.is/eaMxdN1OEey1MmNloeLx_g/docdrop.org/download_annotation_doc/project_muse_765255-lcc1h.pdf)  — 

   - Annotation: such as a person or pair/group of people who'd rather treat the symptoms rather than the cause? ("‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only <s>Nation</s> House Where This Regularly Happens" -- *The Onion*)- It is as if the house is waiting to stage a tragedy, but must find the right actors. As it searches for them, it enacts fragments of the action, as if rehearsing — [Updated on 2022-05-27 08:51:47](https://hyp.is/zlDVeN1OEey_W5sc7SdZYA/docdrop.org/download_annotation_doc/project_muse_765255-lcc1h.pdf)  — 

   - Annotation: Ohh you know, if I'd red this, I'd think this is just a spacetime anomaly where the story plays out when certain conditions are met, and the house is just the setting. But I agree with this take, actually.- how to defeat them — [Updated on 2022-05-27 08:52:29](https://hyp.is/50W-Nt1OEey4DC_-wd0Now/docdrop.org/download_annotation_doc/project_muse_765255-lcc1h.pdf)  — 

   - Annotation: And *why* are we always trying to "defeat them" anyways??
